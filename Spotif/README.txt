We had big problems while using Maven with Github, as we are still learning how to use them.
So we follow the steps indicated in the Configuration Management Plan, and we created a new
branch called General where we will upload the next iterations up to the end of the project.

Problems and Decisions Taken:
	-We had a problem while managing the iterations in its corresponding branch, as Maven is
	not really useful while working with different branches and modules.
	Decision Taken: We create a General Branch where we will create the different modules
	corresponding to each one of the iterations.
